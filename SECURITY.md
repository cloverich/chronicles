# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest stable version is supported with security updates. Critical updates are released as needed, with non-critical patches included in the next regular release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open a Github Issue in this repository **with a proof of concept** that shows the security vulnerability. Please do not open an issue without this proof of concept, as we cannot fix anything without this.

For feedback or discussions about general security practices (e.g., feature requests, opinions on improving security), please open an issue in this repository. See also the electron guidelines on security practices, which this repository intends to follow: https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security

## Bounty

We **currently do not** offer a bounty for discovering vulnerabilities. However, we greatly appreciate your contributions and can credit your work in our changelog and release announcement. Thank you for helping to improve the app's security.
