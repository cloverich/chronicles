# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2024-01-12_

This privacy policy explains how your data is handled when using the **Chronicles** note-taking application.

## **Core Principles**

- **Local-Only by Default:** All your data is stored locally on your device. **Chronicles** does not transmit your data to external servers unless explicitly enabled by you.
- **Transparency:** If any feature introduces data sharing or online communication, it will be obvious, opt-in, and configurable.
- **Control:** You own your data. You can export, delete, or manage your notes as you see fit.

## **What Data We Collect**

### **By Default (Local-Only Usage)**

- **No Personal Data Collected:** The app operates locally and does not collect or send any personal data to external services.

### **Planned and Future Opt-In Features**

1. **Auto-Update (Planned)**

   - When enabled, the app may periodically check for updates by reaching out to a trusted server.
   - No identifiable data is sent, only version-related metadata (e.g., installed version vs. available version).

2. **Crash Reporting (Planned)**

   - If implemented, crash reports will be sent only with your explicit consent.
   - Reports may include error logs, system information (OS version, app version), and other non-personal information necessary to diagnose the issue.

3. **Geolocation in Notes (Planned)**

   - If enabled, the app may request access to your location for embedding location metadata in a note.
   - This feature will always be opt-in, and you will be prompted before any location access.

4. **Spellchecker (Planned)**
   - If implemented, the spellchecker may involve using a local or remote service (e.g., system libraries or cloud-based APIs).
   - Details will be clearly communicated if remote services are used.

## **Third-Party Services**

- The current version of the app uses no third-party services to sync or store your data.
- If a third-party service is introduced in the future (e.g., cloud sync), it will be configurable, optional, and detailed in this privacy policy.

---

## **Your Control Over Your Data**

- **Local Backups:** Chronicles stores notes as plain text markdown files in a directory of your choosing. Back this up using typical strategies like iCloud, Dropbox, Git, etc.
- **Data Deletion:** Uninstalling the app will remove the cached Chronicles data, but leave your notes in place.
- **No Account Required:** There is no need to create an account or provide any personal information to use the app.

## **Changes to This Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy may be updated to reflect new features or changes in how the app handles data. Significant changes will be highlighted in the app or in release announcements. You can always review the latest version of this policy on [GitHub/Website Link].
