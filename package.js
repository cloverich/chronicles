/**

 *
 * This file was created specifically to handle re-building sqlite3
 * That is, sqlite3 is a _native_ dependency, and where there is a mis-match
 * between the development nodejs version, and the target electron version of nodejs (v8?),
 * native dependencies need to be re-compiled for the target platform.
 *
 * This is required anytime the app is built and packaged for distribution, so it
 * should be run as part of the build script.
 *
 * The build.sh script could handle this functionality, but it would need to
 * run after node_modules are installed IN the packaged directory
 *
 * This is also true for any additional architecture beyond whatever macos supports.
