# remark-slate-transformer

This is a partial fork of https://github.com/inokawa/remark-slate-transformer

I did this to quickly modify some of the output node types when converting mdast to slate.

If it works, consider formally forking, or opening a PR to the original repo and in particular:

# mdast-util-ofm

Partial fork of https://github.com/MoritzRS/obsidian-ext initially because of ESM import issues. I need no immediate modifications of this project and if / once this project completes esm updates may be preferable to move this back to a dependency.
