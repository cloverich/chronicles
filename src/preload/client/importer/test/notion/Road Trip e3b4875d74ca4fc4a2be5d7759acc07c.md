# West coast road trip 2022

Notes for our 2022 road trip — where to stay, budget, etc

# Time Frame

Leave: Friday, May 13 2022

Arrive: Friday, May 27 2022

I’m aiming to have two weeks off from work. I circled Friday the 13th but in reality I’d likely leave on Saturday the 14th and take the _following_ two weeks off.

Its about 40 hours from Austin to Portland up the coast, going through San Diego and Aptos. ~20 of those hours are the Austin → San Diego Leg that the kids won’t be on.

# Decision Points

Things we need to decide

- [x] Drive with kids or fly the kids
      We’ll fly the kids to SD with Angela, Chris and Manny will drive to SD
- [x] Drive both cars or one car (could ship one)
      Both
- [x] Stay at Bernies?
- [ ] Do we turn inland (away from Coast? When?)

# Getting to the West coast (by May 16th)

- Chris and Manny to drive
- Wife and kids to fly...

Its about 22 hours to drive. Budgeting 3 days with a stop in El Paso, we can probably do the drive in two. So if we are all there by May 16th, that leaves us a full 10+ days to make it up the coast.
