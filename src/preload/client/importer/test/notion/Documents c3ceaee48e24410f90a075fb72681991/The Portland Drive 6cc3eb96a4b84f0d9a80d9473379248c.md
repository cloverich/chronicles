The epilogue to the [West coast road trip 2022](../Road%20Trip%20e3b4875d74ca4fc4a2be5d7759acc07c.md)

From Austin to Portland in ~~2487~~ 2520 miles. Two vehicles, many stops. Change of drivers and many changes of scenery. A few missed opportunities but no snags. We left the sunshine behind but brought the gratitude along with us and arrived in the overcast city we’ve talked about moving to for almost a decade. Time will tell if it was a good choice but the decision — not change for changes sake but for going after the things you want in life — I am sure we’ll be satisfied with the decision.

In case I lose it, the map is [https://goo.gl/maps/rEXdwZqoHiAnt1T88.](https://goo.gl/maps/gCYcu9cuJ16NZTCX6) I’d like to stylize it, but can’t figure it out.

# By the numbers

We took two vehicles. One drank significantly more gas than the other. I am grateful we did not have any hiccups on the road, although with the preparation we did it wasn’t purely luck

Miles: 2,520

- Gas: 9 stops, $966
  In total, our gas consumption was:
  Total Jeep: 587.22, 8 gas stops
  Total (VW Passat): 378.78, 7 gas stops
  Total: 966
  This is actually pretty close to what I predicted ($830) and less than it felt. Every time I saw that gas total approach $100 my stomach churned. But in hindsight, it didn’t add up to as much as I’d thought.
- Hotels: $1091
  We stopped for the night at the following places:
  - El Paso: Casa Lopez
  - Blythe, CA: 2 motel rooms, ??? (I guess 250, on old card)
  - San Luis Obispo: 2 motel rooms (Peach Tree Inn), 247.74
  - ...

![We ran into Otto, an old colleague of mine, at a rest stop outside of Fredericksburg. He was the first person I remember talking to about the Portland move — 7 or 8 years ago? Wild.](The%20Portland%20Drive%206cc3eb96a4b84f0d9a80d9473379248c/IMG_1988.jpg)
